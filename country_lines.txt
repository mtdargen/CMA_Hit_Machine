<l> He said "I've been where you've been before
<l>  Down every hallway's a slamming door
<l>  No way out no one to come and save me
<l>  Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me
<l>  Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
<l>  Opened my eyes and told me the truth"
<l>  They said "Just a little faith it'll all get better"
<l>  So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm changed
<l>  And now I'm stronger
<l>  There must've been something in the water
<l>  Oh there must've been something in the water
<l>  Well I heard what he said and I went on my way
<l>  Didn't think about it for a couple of days
<l>  Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
<l>  I was all out of hope and all out of fight
<l>  Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
<l>  Saying "God if you're there come and rescue me"
<l>  Felt love pouring down from above
<l>  Got washed in the water washed in the blood and now I'm changed
<l>  And now I'm stronger
<l>  There must be something in the water
<l>  Oh there must be something in the water
<l>  And now I'm singing along to amazing grace
<l>  Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
<l>  Got joy in my heart angels on my side
<l>  Thank God almighty I saw the light
<l>  Gonna look ahead no turning back
<l>  Live every day give it all that I have
<l>  Trust in someone bigger than me
<l>  Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
<l>  And now I'm stronger
<l> You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
<l>  You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
<l>  You keep on flirtin' cause you know that it's workin'
<l>  You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
<l>  Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
<l>  Let's light it up like it's our last night
<l>  We're just hanging around
<l>  Burnin' it down
<l>  Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
<l>  Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby

<l>  All up after the sun goes down
<l>  They say nothin' good happens here
<l>  When midnight rolls around
<l>  But layin' down would be in vain
<l>  I can't sleep with you on my brain
<l>  And I ain't anywhere close to tired
<l>  Your kiss has got me wired
<l>  Girl you got the beat right killin' in your Levis
<l>  High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
<l>  It's still early out in Cali baby don't you wanna rally again
<l>  We'll find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane
<l>  The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
<l>  We'll be rolling down the windows I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
<l>  We don't have to go home we can leave the night on
<l>  We can leave the night on
<l>  Now all the stars are turnin' blue
<l>  Just kissed the clock 2:22
<l>  Baby I know what you're wishin' for
<l>  I'm wishin' for it too
<l>  Now all the lights are flashin' gold
<l>  Nobody cares how fast we go
<l>  Our soundtrack's in the stereo
<l>  This DJ's on a roll
<l>  Girl you got the beat right killin' in your Levis
<l>  High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
<l>  It's still early out in Cali baby don't you wanna rally again
<l>  We'll find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane

<l>  We don't have to go home we can leave the night on
<l>  We can leave the night on
<l>  The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
<l>  So let's take one more trip around the moon
<l>  Everybody's always waiting on Friday
<l>  Watching that clock and sitting on go
<l>  Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
<l>  An open umbrella on the patio
<l>  I don't need a reason or a happy hour
<l>  And hang around for a fireworks show
<l>  Get a head start a little sip of somethin'
<l>  Off and running here we go
<l>  1 2 3 here we go
<l>  Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking
<l>  We could be feeling alright
<l>  I know you know what I'm thinking
<l>  Why don't we do a little day drinking
<l>  Why don't we do a little day drinking
<l>  Blame it on the work day

<l>  Blame it on the tick-tock moving too slow
<l>  Blame it on any old thing you want to
<l>  Ready get set baby here we go

<l>  I've been ridin' 'round cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
<l>  Cried and dried these tears
<l>  I don't know how much more missin' you I can take
<l>  I prayed prayed prayed
<l>  For a sign sign sign
<l>  Now there it is in the window

<l>  With a big pitcher of someone new
<l>  That blonde blonde blonde
<l>  At the bar bar bar
<l>  See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart heart heart

<l>  It’s got me feeling alright go on and make it a double
<l>  There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel tunnel tunnel
<l>  When we were together
<l>  I thought life would suck forever
<l>  Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
<l>  They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
<l>  Gets kissed by the day break got down on my knees
<l>  And I prayed prayed prayed
<l>  For a sign sign sign
<l>  Now there it is in the window

<l>  You get your hands in it plant your roots in it
<l>  Dusty head lights dance with your boots in it
<l>  You write her name on it spin your tires on it
<l>  Build your corn field whiskey bonfires on it
<l>  You bet your life on it
<l>  It’s that elm shade red rust clay you grew up on
<l>  That plowed-up ground that your dad damned his luck on
<l>  That post-game party field you circle up on
<l>  And when it rains you get stuck on
<l>  Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
<l>  The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
<l>  Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
<l>  Makes you wanna build ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
<l>  You mix some sweat with it taking a shovel to it
<l>  You stuck some crosses and some painted goal posts through it (damn)
<l>  You know you came from it and someday you’ll return to this
<l>  elm shade red rust clay you grew up on
<l>  That plowed-up ground that your dad damned his luck on

<l>  If she was a drink
<l>  She'd be a single-barrelled
<l>  Bourbon on ice
<l>  Smooth with a kick
<l>  A chill and a burn all
<l>  At the same time
<l>  She's Sunday drive meets
<l>  High speed chase
<l>  She ain't just a song
<l>  She's the whole mix tape
<l>  She's so complicated
<l>  That's the way God made her
<l>  Sunshine mixed with
<l>  A little hurricane
<l>  Woah-oh-oh
<l>  And she destroys me in that t-shirt
<l>  And I love her so much it hurts
<l>  I never meant to fall like this
<l>  She don't just rain she pours
<l>  That girl right there's
<l>  The perfect storm
<l>  I know how to make her laugh
<l>  Or blush or mad at me
<l>  But that's OK there ain't no one
<l>  More beautiful angry
<l>  And she loves just as deep
<l>  As she goes when she's down
<l>  The highs match the lows
<l>  Can't have one without the other
<l>  And I love her just the way
<l>  God made her
<l>  Sunshine mixed with
<l>  A little hurricane
<l>  And she destroys me in that t-shirt
<l>  And I love her so much it hurts
<l>  I never meant to fall like this
<l>  But she don't just rain she pours
<l>  That girl right there's
<l>  The perfect storm
<l>  She's the girl of a lifetime
<l>  A guy like me spends his whole life
<l>  Looking for that girl right there's
<l>  The perfect storm
<l>  Woah-oh-oh
<l>  Woah-oh-oh
<l>  She had a cross around her neck
<l>  And a flower in her hand
<l>  That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
<l>  On our way to the sand
<l>  We found an old wooden chair
<l>  Still warm from the sun
<l>  Pushed it back gave me a kiss
<l>  With Bacardi on her lips
<l>  And I was done
<l> And we spent that week wide open
<l>  Upside down beside the ocean
<l>  I didn't know where it was goin'
<l>  Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
<l>  I should've known that kind of feelin'
<l>  Would last longer than that week did
<l>  Blown away and barely breathin'
<l>  Sunday came and it was over
<l>  Now she's got me twisted
<l>  Like an old beach roller coaster
<l>  The rest of those days
<l>  Turned into long crazy nights
<l>  When the music got loud
<l>  We'd sneak away from the crowd
<l>  Under the boardwalk lights
<l>  And with all the things we said
<l>  What I just can't get past
<l>  Is the way we let it end
<l>  Now I'm wonderin' where she is
<l>  Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back
<l>  She's like a song playin' over and over
<l>  In my mind where I still hold her
<l>  I had the chance and I should've told her
<l>  When we spent that week wide open
<l>  Upside down beside the ocean
<l>  I should've known where it was goin'
<l>  Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
<l>  And I should've known that kind of feelin'
<l>  Would last longer than that week did
<l>  Blown away and barely breathin'
<l>  When Sunday came and it was over
<l>  Now she's got me twisted
<l>  Yeah I'm still twisted
<l>  Like that old beach roller coaster
<l>  Like that old beach roller coaster
<l> Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top
<l>  Jack in her Cherry Coke town
<l>  Momma and daddy put their roots right here
<l>  'Cause this is where the car broke down
<l>  Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust

<l>  A little messed up but we're all alright
<l>  It was the summer before the real world started and
<l>  The deal was we would get to go if we
<l>  Cleaned it up and got it running
<l>  Daddy's old Winnebago
<l>  Wing and a prayer down 65
<l>  Five best friends on four bald tires
<l>  I can still see Billy smiling
<l>  When we finally made it
<l>  To Talladega boys raised up
<l>  Whiskey in your glass here's to turning up
<l>  Slowing down and cars that go real fast
<l>  We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
<l>  And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
<l>  Sure would like to stay in Talladega
<l>  Like a storm time rolls on
<l>  You can't hit pause as we just did
<l>  Most days in life don't stand out
<l>  But life's about those days that will like
<l>  Rocking rando getting rowdy
<l>  Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
<l>  til the Alabama sun was breaking
<l>  Over Talladega boys raised up
<l>  Whiskey in your glass here's to turning up
<l>  Slowing down and cars that go real fast
<l>  We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
<l>  And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
<l>  Sure would like to stay in Talladega
<l>  When the winds go cold and it blows October
<l>  I think about us shoulder to shoulder
<l>  Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
<l>  In my mind
<l>  Tonight I'm in Talladega boys raised up
<l>  Whiskey in your glass here's to turning up
<l>  Slowing down and cars that go real fast
<l>  We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
<l>  And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
<l>  Sure would like to stay in Talladega
<l>  8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
<l>  All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
<l>  Saying come on he ain’t worth the pain
<l>  Do what you gotta do to forget his name
<l>  Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
<l>  Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
<l>  Check the mirror one last time
<l>  And kiss the past goodbye
<l>  What I’m really needing now
<l>  Is a double shot of Crown
<l>  Chase that disco ball around
<l> ‘Til I don’t remember
<l>  Go until they cut me off
<l>  Wanna get a little lost
<l>  In the noise in the lights
<l>  Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
<l> ‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
<l>  Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
<l>  Hey bartender
<l>  Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
<l>  Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
<l>  But before it goes too far
<l>  I’ll let him down easy
<l> ‘Cause tonight it’s all about
<l>  Dancing with my girls to the DJ

<l> And we were dancing all night long
<l>  To a sweet old Alabama song
