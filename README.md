CMA_Hit_Machine
===============

generate the next smash hit country song

You can run "country.py" for instant fun, or add your fav country songs to the "songs.txt" file, run "songlines.py", and then run "country.py" for slightly delayed but more personal fun

What's inside:
  * country.py - main program
  * songs.txt - file containing the lyrics to the top 25 country songs as of 11/19/2014
  * country_lines.txt - songs.txt, but formatted so that country.py can use it
