He said, "I've been where you've been before.
 Down every hallway's a slamming door.
 No way out, no one to come and save me.
 Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me.

 Then somebody said what I'm saying to you,
 Opened my eyes and told me the truth."
 They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better."
 So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm changed
 And now I'm stronger

 There must've been something in the water
 Oh, there must've been something in the water

 Well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
 Didn't think about it for a couple of days
 Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
 I was all out of hope and all out of fight

 Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
 Saying, "God, if you're there come and rescue me."
 Felt love pouring down from above
 Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm changed
 And now I'm stronger

 There must be something in the water
 Oh, there must be something in the water

 And now I'm singing along to amazing grace
 Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
 Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
 Thank God almighty, I saw the light
 Gonna look ahead, no turning back
 Live every day, give it all that I have
 Trust in someone bigger than me
 Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
 And now I'm stronger

You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
 You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
 You keep on flirtin' cause you know that it's workin'
 You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
 Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
 Let's light it up like it's our last night

 We're just hanging around
 Burnin' it down
 Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
 Jammin' to some old Alabama with you, baby
 Laying right here naked in my bed
 I'm just doing my thing
 You love it when I sing
 Say it makes you feel like an angel
 We about to get a little tangled up right about now
 So girl let's keep burnin' it down
 Burnin' it down
 Burnin' it down

 Girl when you want it, you know that I'm on it
 You know that I love lovin' up on you
 Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
 And light it up like it's our last chance

 We're just hanging around
 Burnin' it down
 Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
 Jammin' to some old Alabama with you, baby
 Laying right here dreaming in my bed
 I'm just doing my thing
 You love it when I sing
 Say it makes you feel like an angel
 We about to get a little tangled up right about now
 So girl let's keep burnin' it down

 I wanna rock it all night
 Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?
 I wanna crawl through the dark
 Just to feel your heartbeat against me

 We're just hanging around
 Burnin' it down
 Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
 Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
 Laying right here naked in my bed
 I'm just doing my thing
 You love it when I sing
 Say it makes you feel like an angel
 We about to get a little tangled up right about now
 So girl let's keep burnin' it down

 I wanna rock it all night
 Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?
 I wanna crawl through the dark
 Just to feel your heartbeat against me

 They roll the sidewalks in this town
 All up after the sun goes down
 They say nothin' good happens here
 When midnight rolls around
 But layin' down would be in vain
 I can't sleep with you on my brain
 And I ain't anywhere close to tired
 Your kiss has got me wired

 Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
 High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
 It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
 We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
 The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
 We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
 We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
 We can leave the night on

 Now all the stars are turnin' blue
 Just kissed the clock 2:22
 Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
 I'm wishin' for it too
 Now all the lights are flashin' gold
 Nobody cares how fast we go
 Our soundtrack's in the stereo
 This DJ's on a roll

 Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
 High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
 It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
 We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
 The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
 We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
 We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
 We can leave the night on

 The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
 So let's take one more trip around the moon

 Everybody's always waiting on Friday
 Watching that clock and sitting on go
 Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
 An open umbrella on the patio

 I don't need a reason or a happy hour
 And hang around for a fireworks show
 Get a head start a little sip of somethin'
 Off and running here we go
 1, 2, 3 here we go

 Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking
 We could be feeling alright
 I know you know what I'm thinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking

 Blame it on the work day
 Blame it on the heatwave
 Blame it on the tick-tock moving too slow
 Blame it on any old thing you want to
 Ready get set, baby here we go

 Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking
 We could be feeling alright
 I know you know what I'm thinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking
 Day drinking, day drinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking

 Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking
 We could be feeling alright
 I know you know what I'm thinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking

 Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking
 We could be feeling all right
 I know you know what I'm thinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking
 Why don't we do a little day drinking

 Ever since you left me
 I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
 Cried and dried these tears
 I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

 I prayed, prayed, prayed
 For a sign, sign, sign
 Now there it is in the window
 It's about time, damn time

 There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel
 It ain’t all that bright, but even though it’s subtle
 It’s got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
 There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

 I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
 Chase that one with a cold screw you
 When that's done, I just might wash it down
 With a big pitcher of someone new

 That blonde, blonde, blonde
 At the bar, bar, bar
 See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

 There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel
 It ain’t all that bright, but even though it’s subtle
 It’s got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
 There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

 When we were together
 I thought life would suck forever
 Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
 They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
 Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

 And I prayed, prayed, prayed
 For a sign, sign, sign
 Now there it is in the window
 It's about time, damn time

 There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel
 It ain’t all that bright, but even though it’s subtle
 It’s got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
 There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

 I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
 That's alright cause I don't want to be alone
 There's nobody waitin there, cold and empty bed
 Words I wished Id said come on the radio

 Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I do this to myself
 Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're with someone else

 But in my mind were somewhere in my car
 And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
 You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
 I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
 And your fingertips slide up and down my back
 Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
 Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

 So, I've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
 Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
 I should take down all those pictures from my wall
 Promises we made won't fill this empty space

 Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go
 Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're never coming back

 But in my mind were somewhere in my car
 And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
 You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
 I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
 And your fingertips slide up and down my back
 Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
 Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

 But in my mind were somewhere in my car
 And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow

 I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
 And your fingertips slide up and down my back
 Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
 Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

Roll, won’t you come roll with me slow, fast, full speed
 Girl wherever sweet time takes us
 Hang, with me down this old road
 Only god knows where we’ll go
 Don’t matter long as I’ve got your love

 I don’t ever want to wake up,
 Lookin’ into someone else’s eyes
 Another Voice calling me baby
 On the other end of the phone
 A new girl puttin’ on her makeup
 Before dinner on Friday night
 No I don’t ever wanna know, Oh O
 No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin’ to the radio, Woohoo Oh O

 Slide, slide over nice and close
 Lay your head down on my shoulder
 You can fall asleep I’ll let you
 Dream, life aint nothing but a dream, don’t wanna be
 Cruisin’ through this dream without you

 I don’t ever want to wake up,
 Lookin’ into someone else’s eyes
 Another Voice calling me baby
 On the other end of the phone
 A new girl puttin’ on her makeup
 Before dinner on Friday night
 No I don’t ever wanna know, Oh O
 No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin’ to the radio, Woohoo Oh O
 No other shotgun rider, Oh O

 I don’t ever want to wake up,
 Lookin’ into someone else’s eyes
 Another Voice calling me baby
 On the other end of the phone
 A new girl puttin’ on her makeup
 Before dinner on Friday night
 No I don’t ever wanna know, Oh O
 No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin’ to the radio, Woohoo Oh O

 No other shotgun rider, Oh O

 Singin’ to the radio, Oh O

 You’re my shotgun rider.

 You get your hands in it, plant your roots in it
 Dusty head lights dance with your boots in it
 You write her name on it, spin your tires on it
 Build your corn field, whiskey bonfires on it
 You bet your life on it

 It’s that elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
 That plowed-up ground that your dad damned his luck on
 That post-game party field you circle up on
 And when it rains you get stuck on
 Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
 The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
 Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
 Makes you wanna build ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

 You mix some sweat with it, taking a shovel to it
 You stuck some crosses and some painted goal posts through it (damn)

 You know you came from it and someday you’ll return to this...

 ...elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
 That plowed-up ground that your dad damned his luck on
 That post-game party field you circle up on
 And when it rains you get stuck on
 Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
 The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
 Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
 Makes you wanna build a ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

 You know you came from it and someday you’ll return to this...

 If she was a drink
 She'd be a single-barrelled
 Bourbon on ice
 Smooth with a kick
 A chill and a burn all
 At the same time

 She's Sunday drive meets
 High speed chase
 She ain't just a song
 She's the whole mix tape
 She's so complicated
 That's the way God made her
 Sunshine mixed with
 A little hurricane

 Woah-oh-oh

 And she destroys me in that t-shirt
 And I love her so much it hurts
 I never meant to fall like this
 She don't just rain she pours
 That girl right there's
 The perfect storm

 I know how to make her laugh
 Or blush, or mad at me
 But that's OK there ain't no one
 More beautiful angry

 And she loves just as deep
 As she goes when she's down
 The highs match the lows
 Can't have one without the other
 And I love her just the way
 God made her
 Sunshine mixed with
 A little hurricane

 And she destroys me in that t-shirt
 And I love her so much it hurts
 I never meant to fall like this
 But she don't just rain she pours
 That girl right there's
 The perfect storm

 She's the girl of a lifetime
 A guy like me spends his whole life
 Looking for, that girl right there's
 The perfect storm
 Woah-oh-oh
 Woah-oh-oh

 She had a cross around her neck
 And a flower in her hand
 That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
 On our way to the sand
 We found an old wooden chair
 Still warm from the sun
 Pushed it back, gave me a kiss
 With Bacardi on her lips
 And I was done

And we spent that week wide open
 Upside down beside the ocean
 I didn't know where it was goin'
 Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
 I should've known that kind of feelin'
 Would last longer than that week did
 Blown away and barely breathin'
 Sunday came and it was over
 Now she's got me twisted
 Like an old beach roller coaster

 The rest of those days
 Turned into long crazy nights
 When the music got loud
 We'd sneak away from the crowd
 Under the boardwalk lights
 And with all the things we said
 What I just can't get past
 Is the way we let it end
 Now I'm wonderin' where she is
 Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

 She's like a song playin' over and over
 In my mind, where I still hold her
 I had the chance and I should've told her

 When we spent that week wide open
 Upside down beside the ocean
 I should've known where it was goin'
 Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
 And I should've known that kind of feelin'
 Would last longer than that week did
 Blown away and barely breathin'
 When Sunday came and it was over
 Now she's got me twisted,
 Yeah, I'm still twisted
 Like that old beach roller coaster

 Like that old beach roller coaster

Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top
 Jack in her Cherry Coke town
 Momma and daddy put their roots right here
 'Cause this is where the car broke down
 Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust
 Pickin' us up by a barbed wire fence
 MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

 We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
 Born in the USA
 Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
 New York to LA
 We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
 Baby, come give me a kiss
 Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
 Uptown down home American kids
 Growin' up in little pink houses
 Makin' out on living room couches
 Blowin' that smoke on Saturday night
 A little messed up, but we're all alright

 Baptist church parkin' lot, tryin' not to get caught
 Take her home and give her your jacket
 Makin' it to second base, but sayin' you went all the way
 Monday afternoon at practice
 Sister's got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
 Now he's sittin' out back, 3030 in his lap
 In the blue bug zapper light

 We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
 Born in the USA
 Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
 New York to LA
 We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
 Baby, come give me a kiss
 Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
 Uptown down home American kids
 Growin' up in little pink houses
 Makin' out on living room couches
 Blowin' that smoke on Saturday night
 A little messed up, but we're all alright

 It was the summer before the real world started and,
 The deal was we would get to go, if we
 Cleaned it up, and got it running,
 Daddy's old Winnebago.

 Wing and a prayer down 65,
 Five best friends on four bald tires,
 I can still see Billy smiling
 When we finally made it.

 To Talladega, boys raised up,
 Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
 Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

 We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
 And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
 Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

 Like a storm, time rolls on,
 You can't hit pause as we just did.
 Most days in life don't stand out,
 But life's about those days that will, like,

 Rocking rando, getting rowdy,
 Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
 til the Alabama sun was breaking.

 Over Talladega, boys raised up,
 Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
 Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

 We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
 And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
 Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

 When the winds go cold and it blows October,
 I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
 Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over,
 In my mind.

 Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raised up,
 Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
 Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

 We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
 And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
 Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.
 8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
 All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
 Saying come on he ain’t worth the pain
 Do what you gotta do to forget his name

 Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
 Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
 Check the mirror one last time
 And kiss the past goodbye

 What I’m really needing now
 Is a double shot of Crown
 Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
 Go until they cut me off
 Wanna get a little lost
 In the noise, in the lights

 Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
 Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
 Hey bartender

 Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
 Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
 But before it goes too far
 I’ll let him down easy
‘Cause tonight it’s all about
 Dancing with my girls to the DJ
 Put that song on replay

 What I’m really needing now
 Is a double shot of Crown
 Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
 Go until they cut me off
 Wanna get a little lost
 In the noise, in the lights

 Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
 Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
 Hey bartender

 I’m feeling that buzz
 I’m ready to rock
 Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
 So pour that thing up to the top
 I’m coming in hot

 Hey bartender
 What I’m really needing now
 Is a double shot of Crown
 Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
 Go until they cut me off
 Wanna get a little lost
 In the noise, in the lights

 Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
 Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
 Hey bartender
 Hey bartender



Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,
 cuttin' right through me.
 You set me on the rewind, back to the good times,
 when you couldn't get enough of me.

 Sayin' all the things I never did say.
 I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do.
 Baby, when I look at you.

 Yeah, baby when I look at you.

 Last thing I thought I'd see was,
 you across the bar from me, and
 holdin' on to that turkey bottle,
 shootin' em down, and runnin' full throttle.

 Keeps runnin' through my my mind.

 or close it out and head to my truck, and
 drive away as fast as I can
 and forget we ever bucked.

 Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,
 they're cuttin' right through me.
 You set me on the rewind, back to the good times,

 I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
 I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
 Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
 And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
 If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
 The way that it's going, the keg gon' be floating

 All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
 Work a little less, play a little more
 That's what this day is for
 And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
 Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
 With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

 Girl you know you're the life of my party
 You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
 Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
 If you want you can get on Harley
 I sit you up on a kitchen sink
 Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
 The way that we're feeling we gone by this evening

 All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
 Work a little less, play a little more
 That's what this day is for
 And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
 Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
 With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

 With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

 Well take a look at what's left in that sunset,
 Fireflies popping like the Fourth of July, yeah.
 You're gonna wanna see every single thing I'm gonna show you tonight.
 Got the perfect scene set of a moonlight glowing,
 Just keep them baby blues wide open.
 Girl take a look around, yeah it's going down.
 It's going down just right.

 Hey baby fore the night gets any older,
 Lean your pretty self over here a little closer.
 I need to hold ya,
 I wanna show ya what you don't wanna miss, no.
 It's all getting to what we've been waiting on.
 I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on.
 Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips.
 Might wanna close your eyes for this.

 Sun gone down, nights are getting hotter.
 We've got this bed backed up to the water.
 Yeah it's the place to be if you wanna see every little shining star.
 But that view ain't nothing like the you I'm lookin at,
 Two tan legs for days dangling off the back.
 It all looks better baby you can see forever when you're here in my arms.

 Hey baby fore the night gets any older,
 Lean your pretty self over here a little closer.
 I need to hold ya,
 I wanna show ya what you don't wanna miss, no.

 Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips.

 Just when you thought you had seen it all,
 Well it turns out you don't have to see it all.

 Hey baby fore the night gets any older,
 Lean your pretty self over here a little closer.

 Close your eyes for this.

We're up when the rooster crows
 Clock in when the whistle blows
 Eight hours ticking slow
 And then tomorrow we'll do it all over again

 I'm a member of a blue collar crowd
 They can never, nah they can't keep us down
 If you gotta, gotta label me, label me proud

 I belong to the drinking class
 Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
 If you're one of us, raise your glass
 I belong to the drinking class

 We laugh, we cry, we love
 Go hard when the going's tough
 Push back, come push and shove
 Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

 I'm a member of a good timing crowd
 We get rowdy, we get wild and loud
 If you gotta, gotta label me, label me proud

 I belong to the drinking class
 Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
 If you're one of us, raise your glass
 I belong to the drinking class

 We all know why we're here
 A little fun, a little music, a little whiskey, a little beer
 We're gonna shake off those long week blues
 Ladies, break out your dancing shoes
 It don't matter what night it is, it's Friday
 It's Saturday and Sunday
 I just want to hear you say
 I just want to hear you sing it
 Y'all sing it with me

 We belong to the drinking class
 Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
 If you're one of us, raise your glass
 We belong to the drinking class

 Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
 And if you're one of us, raise your glass
 We belong to the drinking class

 I'm feelin' it

 Pop tops poppin'
 Flip-flops floppin'
 Drop tops droppin' down
 Ray-Bans rayin'
 Waves are wavin'
 Ladies are layin' out
 Feelin' it

 iPods rockin'
 Sunblock blockin'
 Igloos stockin' up (yep)
 Cutoffs are cuttin'
 Worry 'bout nothin'
 But puttin' something in my cup (feelin' it)

 And I can't, I can't find nothin' wrong
 With nothin', nothin' that's goin' on
 It's makin' me wanna sing a song
 That goes like this

 Whoa, oh, whoa
 Ain't nothin' like feelin' that summertime feelin'
 Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
 I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
 Whoa, oh, whoa
 Ain't nothin' like diggin' that summertime
 Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
 With your hand in my hand
 I'm feelin' it
 Oh yeah, I'm feelin' it

 Rip tide rippin'
 Skim board skimmin'
 Sip, sippin' somethin' on ice (fill it up)
 Hot gets hotter
 Head to the water
 Jump into paradise (feelin' it)

 And I can't, I can't find nothin' wrong
 With nothin', nothin' that's goin' on
 It's makin' me wanna sing a song
 That goes like this (like this)

 Whoa, oh, whoa
 Ain't nothin' like feelin' that summertime feelin'
 Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
 I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
 Whoa, oh, whoa
 Ain't nothin' like diggin' that summertime
 Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
 With your hand in my hand
 I'm feelin' it
 Oh, I'm feelin' it

 Sunset settin'
 Gettin' good's gettin'
 Good as it can get
 Lip gloss glossin'
 No more talkin'
 Baby givin' me a kiss
 (Feelin' it)

 Whoa, oh, whoa
 Ain't nothin' like feelin' that summertime feelin'
 Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
 I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
 Whoa, oh, whoa
 Ain't nothin' like diggin' that summertime
 Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
 With your hand in my hand
 I'm feelin' it
 Oh yeah, oh I'm feelin' it

 Pop tops poppin'
 iPods rockin'
 Flip-flops floppin'
 Oh, I'm feelin' it

 Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
 Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

 Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
 Had to back it on up, couldn’t make it to the service
 Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
 Got a real good feelin’ something bad about to happen

 Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
 Rolled down a window, where you heading to next?
 Said I’m heading to the bar with my money out the mattress
 Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen…

 Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
 Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
 Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
 Wake up in the morning’ don’t know what happened
 Whoa… Something bad
 Whoa… Something bad

 Now me and that girl that I met on the street
 We’re rollin’ down the road, down to New Orleans
 Got a full tank of gas and the money out the mattress
 Got a real good feelin’ something bad about to happen

 Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
 Just like a real-life Thelma & Louise
 If the cops catch up, they’re gonna call it Kidnapping
 Got a real good feelin’ something bad about to happen

 Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
 Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
 Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
 Wake up in the morning’ don’t know what happened
 Whoa… Something bad
 Whoa… Something bad

 Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
 Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
 Now the drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
 Wake up in the morning’ don’t know what happened

 Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
 Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
 Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand so God Made Girls

 Somebody's gotta make him get dressed up,
 Give him a reason to wash that truck,
 Somebody's gotta teach him how to dance,
 So God made girls.

 He needed something soft and loud and sweet and proud
 But tough enough to break a heart
 Something beautiful and breakable that lights up in the dark

 So God made girls, God made girls
 He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
 And God made girls (for singing in your front seat)
 God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
 He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
 And God made girls.

 Somebody's gotta be the one to cry
 Somebody's gotta let him drive
 Give him a reason to hold that door so God made girls

 Somebody's gotta put up a fight,
 Make him wait on a Saturday night
 To walk downstairs and blow his mind,
 So God made girls.

 Something that can wake him up and call his bluff and drag his butt to church
 Something that is hard to handle
 Somethin' fragile to hold him when he hurts

 So God made girls, God made girls
 He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
 And God made girls (for singin' in your front seat)
 God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
 He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
 And God made girls

 Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
 Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
 Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand

 So God made girls, God made girls
 He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
 And God made girls (for singin' in your front seat)
 God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
 He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
 And God made girls

 Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
 Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt (and God made girls, yeah)
 Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand

 So God made girls

 Got nowhere to go, all night to get there
 But I'm going there with you
 Tonight we're running on luck
 If we're gonna use it all up
 There's only one thing left to do

 Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
 Twirl you around 'til my head spins
 Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
 Break every rule we ever learned
 Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
 Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
 'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

 You look way too good
 This feels way too right
 It'd been way too long to start
 And it's sure worth drinking to
 So baby here's to you
 I don't wanna waste a drop

 Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
 Twirl you around 'til my head spins
 Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
 Break every rule we ever learned
 Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
 Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
 'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

 One life, one chance
 One ticket to the big dance
 You and me still holding on
 Right down to the last song

 Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
 Twirl you around 'til my head spins
 Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
 Break every rule we ever learned
 Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
 Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
 'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
 Yeah, 'til it's gone

 You're sure worth drinking to
 Baby, here's to you
 I don't wanna waste a drop

 I'm gonna drink it all up
 'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone, it's gone
If I could be the reason your hair's a mess,
 The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest,
 If I could be the voice on your radio,
 Then I could be your long ride home.

 If mine could be the name that changes yours,
 The wine in your glass,
 The swing on your porch,
 The dollar in your pocket,
 And the peaceful in your sleep,
 Then I'd be what you mean to me.

 Standing here,
 Watching you,
 Turning every head in this crowded room,
 The lights down low,
 Dancin slow,
 Oh, if falling's how you feel,
 And perfect is what you see,
 Then I'd be what you mean to me.

 If I could be the fire in your firefly,
 The cool in the rain,
 The spark in your eye,
 The answer to your prayer,
 And the faith that sets you free,
 Then I'd be what you mean to me.

 Standing here,
 Watching you,
 Turning every head in this crowded room,
 The lights down low,
 Dancin slow,
 Oh, if falling's how you feel,
 And perfect is what you see,
 Then I'd be what you mean to me,
 What you mean to me

 And oh,
 All of this talkin makes you laugh,
 But I've gotta let you know just how I'm feeling while I'm
 Standing here,
 Watching you,
 Turning every head in this crowded room,
 The lights down low,
 Dancin slow,
 Oh, if falling's how you feel,
 And perfect is what you see,
 Then I'd be what you mean to me.

 Yea,
 Falling's how you feel,
 And perfect's what you see,
 Then I'd be what you mean to me.
 Be what you mean to me.
 Ohhhhh, be what you mean, what you mean, what you mean, what you mean to me.

 Sitting at a bar in New York City
 Everybody here looking New York pretty
 But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
 Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
 They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
 Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
 Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
 Girl there ain’t nothing hotter

 Ooh, I dig the way that you move
 You shake it down to your roots
 Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
 Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
 I’ll take a sip of that smile
 I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
 You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
 You’re so money, money, money
 You got a country road Carolina soul
 Baby you’re just so homegrown
 Trying to think of something cool to say
 Turned around and saw you walking my way
 Pulled me on the floor saying “Son it’s on”
And we were dancing all night long
 To a sweet old Alabama song

 Ooh baby, baby, baby
 You’re driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
 I’m a long way away from where I’m from
 But baby you feel like home

 You’re so money, money, money
 You got a country road Carolina soul
 Baby you’re just so homegrown
